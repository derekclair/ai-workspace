# IQGeo Conflict Fixer API Instructions

## Overview
These instructions provide guidance for generating and sending mock data to the IQGeo Conflict Fixer application at https://apollo.engineering.iqgeo.cloud/iqgcom_conflict_fixer.html.

## API Endpoints
Base URL: https://apollo.engineering.iqgeo.cloud

(Note: Actual endpoints will need to be documented after API analysis)

## Data Structure Requirements
- Document the expected data structures
- Define validation rules
- List required fields

## Mock Data Guidelines
1. Data should be realistic and varied
2. Include edge cases and common scenarios
3. Follow business domain rules
4. Maintain referential integrity

## Security Considerations
- API authentication requirements
- Rate limiting considerations
- Data sensitivity guidelines

## Tools and Scripts
- List of available tools for data generation
- Validation scripts
- API interaction utilities

## Best Practices
1. Always validate data before sending
2. Log all API interactions
3. Handle rate limiting appropriately
4. Maintain idempotency where possible

## Testing Strategy
1. Verify data structure compliance
2. Test API endpoint responses
3. Validate error handling
4. Check performance impact

(Note: This is an initial template that will be updated as we gather more information about the API and its requirements)
